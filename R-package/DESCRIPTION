Description: Implementation of a supervised version of the ivis algorithm described in the paper:
  'Structure-preserving visualisation of high dimensional single-cell data'.
  This version of the algorithm uses a siamese neural network trained on triplets to reduce the dimensionality of data to two dimensions for visualization.
  Each triplet is sampled from the provided labels, with points of the same label being pulled
  together and those that aren not being pushed away.
